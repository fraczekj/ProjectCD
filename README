Lab 5
Worked on by John and I
Language Grammar:
Program -> stmt
Stmt->stmt-type|Stmt stmt-type
Stmt-type->command
Command-> “CONNECT” arg|”READ ALL DATA” arg|”USE DATABASE” arg|”PUT INTO” arg|”READ ALL DATA FROM” arg|”PRESENT WITH FORMAT” arg
Arg->id|NULL
Id->[a-z A-Z 0-9 ‘.’ ‘:’ ‘@’]*

Valid Code:
CONNECT 255.255.255.255:80
READ ALL DATA
USE DATABASE testdb@localhost
PUT INTO testdb
READ ALL DATA FROM testdb.table
PRESENT WITH FORMAT x

Invalid Code:
Any other commands not listed above

Generated Code using GOLD Parser:
public interface SymbolConstants 
{
   final int SYMBOL_EOF           =  0;  // (EOF)
   final int SYMBOL_ERROR         =  1;  // (Error)
   final int SYMBOL_WHITESPACE    =  2;  // (Whitespace)
   final int SYMBOL_LINE          =  3;  // Line
   final int SYMBOL_NEW           =  4;  // New
   final int SYMBOL_STRING        =  5;  // String
   final int SYMBOL_ARG           =  6;  // <arg>
   final int SYMBOL_COMMAND       =  7;  // <command>
   final int SYMBOL_PROGRAM       =  8;  // <Program>
   final int SYMBOL_STMTS         =  9;  // <Stmts>
   final int SYMBOL_STMTMINUSTYPE = 10;  // <Stmt-type>
};

public interface RuleConstants
{
   final int RULE_PROGRAM        = 0;  // <Program> ::= <Stmts>
   final int RULE_STMTS          = 1;  // <Stmts> ::= <Stmt-type>
   final int RULE_STMTS2         = 2;  // <Stmts> ::= <Stmts> <Stmt-type>
   final int RULE_STMTTYPE       = 3;  // <Stmt-type> ::= <command>
   final int RULE_COMMAND_STRING = 4;  // <command> ::= String <arg>
   final int RULE_ARG_STRING     = 5;  // <arg> ::= String
   final int RULE_ARG_NEW_LINE   = 6;  // <arg> ::= New Line
};

We were unable to get it working.
